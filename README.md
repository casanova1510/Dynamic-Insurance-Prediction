## Overview

Welcome to the dynamic insurance prediction web application! In this project, I used different machine learning techniques to predict insurance charges based on various customer conditions. I have employed a Random Forest Regressor model, which showed superior performance in this analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
git clone <https://github.com/casanova1510/Dynamic-Insurance-Prediction.git>


2. **Navigate to the project directory:**  
cd dynamic-insurance-prediction


3. **Install dependencies:**  
Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required Python packages by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will install necessary packages such as Streamlit for running the application.

## Data Preprocessing and Model Training

We start by loading the dataset and performing essential preprocessing operations to prepare the data for model training.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following versions of packages specified in your `requirements.txt` file:

```text
pandas==1.5.3
numpy==1.22.4
joblib==1.2.0
streamlit==1.24.0
